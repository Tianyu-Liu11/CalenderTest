    "**Task**: \n",
    "\n",
    "To answer the question about optimizing your calendar to have a 30-minute walk time daily, let's break down the requirements and steps needed in the solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps and Breakdown \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pre-filter the DataFrame**:\n",
    "   - Exclude canceled meetings from `filtered_calendar_data` since they do not affect your availability.\n",
    "   - Include only confirmed and tentative meetings as these impact your schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Determine Available Time Slots**:\n",
    "   - For each day within the dataset, calculate the intervals between meetings that are at least 30 minutes long. These are potential walk times.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Daily Time Constraints**:\n",
    "   - Walk times should fit between standard work hours (9:00 AM to 6:00 PM). We must avoid suggesting a walk time that doesn't fit within these hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Sort and Aggregate Walk Times**:\n",
    "   - Prioritize finding at least one 30-minute block per day. If a day already has an available 30-minute block, that's adequate. If not, look into rearranging shorter breaks into one continuous 30-minute block if possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Output the Analysis**:\n",
    "   - For days where it's impossible to arrange a 30-minute walking period due to back-to-back meetings, suggest potential meetings that could be shortened or rescheduled.\n",
    "   - \n",
    "1. **Identify Daily Gaps:** For each day of the week within the data, calculate the time differences between consecutive meetings to find       potential walk slots.\n",
    "2. **Consider Work Hours**: Only consider gaps within the default work hours from \"09:00:00\" to \"18:00:00\".\n",
    "3. **Filter for Adequate Duration**: Identify gaps that are at least 30 minutes long, which could be used for walking.\n",
    "4. **Summarize Gaps**: For days where multiple shorter gaps exist, verify if they cumulatively amount to at least 30 minutes.\n",
    "5. **Provide Recommendations**: Based on this analysis, determine which days already have enough time for walking and which days need schedule adjustments.\n",
    "\n",
    "the approach involves analyzing the gaps between scheduled events where there are no overlaps.\n",
    "1. **Filter valid meetings**: Only consider meetings that are not canceled. This could involve filtering out meetings where the status is 'cancelled'.\n",
    "2. **Identify gaps between meetings**: By iterating through the days covered in the dataset and considering the start and end times of the meetings, we can identify intervals that are free between events. For this, we only consider days and time slots from 09:00:00 to 18:00:00.\n",
    "3. **Consider gaps of a significant length**: In this scenario, a significant length can be defined as a default value (e.g., 30 minutes), where no meetings are scheduled, and hence, the time can be utilized for working on a new project.  \n",
    "4. **Return available time slots**: The output should be the list of available time slots sufficiently large between existing meetings to facilitate effective work on a new project.\n",
