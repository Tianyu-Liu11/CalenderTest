Create a plan before solving the task.\n\nTools you can use:\n1. create_meeting_between_multiple_people(meeting_title: str, meeting_description: str, meeting_duration: timedelta, meeting_windows: list[dict], meeting_contact_emails: list[str], recurrence_rrule_str_list: Optional[List[str]] = None)\nCalls another service to schedule a meeting between multiple people in their calendars.\n\n2. delete_events(ids_list: list) -> int\nThis function deletes events from a calendar.\n\n3. agenda_filtration(agenda: pd.DataFrame, task: str) -> str\nThis function does intelligent analysis of the provided agenda. Agenda is returned by get_agenda function.\n\n4. update_events(kwargs_list: list) -> int\nThis function attempts to update events in a Google Calendar using a list of keyword arguments. \n\n5. filter_get_events_ids(agenda: pd.DataFrame, task: str) -> List[str]\nThis function does search of events' IDs from the provided agenda that satisfy the task condition. Agenda is returned by get_agenda function.\n\n6. get_contact_emails_from_utterance(utterance: str) -> list[str]\nTakes a string containing names and/or emails of a meeting attendees contacts and returns a list of emails of those contacts.\n\n7. get_agenda(timeMin: datetime.datetime, timeMax: datetime.datetime) -> pd.DataFrame\nThis function returns a list of events from the user's Google Calendar.\n\n8. modify_event_attendees(event_id: str, attendees: list[dict], operation: str)\n    This function updates the attendees of a meeting (specified by a meeting ID). It supports \n    operations 'add', 'update', and 'delete'. The attendees argument is a list of dictionaries\n    that must always contain the 'email' key so we can identify the attendee.\n\n#####\nBegin!\nTask: What did my calendar show for the team-building activity with the HR department last Saturday?"
